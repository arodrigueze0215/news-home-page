This project is a challenge I have taken from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl/hub)
 and it has been designed by [Cristian Palomino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-andr%C3%A9s-palomino-maya-8595bb210/) You can see his work through this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/divYJWFMXzPXTSudKQzuTJ/Home-News?node-id=42%3A44&mode=dev)

## Get started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
